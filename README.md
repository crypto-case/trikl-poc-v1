# Trikl - DeFi Copy Trading For Crypto

[Trikl](https://trikl.xyz/) is a DeFi Copy Trading Platform, similar to eToro but decentralized. Our decentralized application (dApp) enables crypto experts to share their high-earning portfolios. Copy traders can instantly clone trades and match portfolios to earn a high return on investment with minimal effort.

## Why We Exist?
Most crypto influencers, who trade and provide signals, preach decentralization and trustless ownership. However, these influencers are forced to use centralized social media groups due to a lack of DeFi platforms catering to their needs. Since they cannot practice what they preach and their operations are opaque and centralized, their followers donâ€™t fully trust them. Moreover, their followers have to use centralized platforms to follow recommendations and manually copy trades.

Trikl is the first of its kind platform to solve these issues with a transparent, on-chain, secure platform that curates the top-performing crypto traders and their recommendations/portfolios, and allows users to invest automatically in a few simple steps.
